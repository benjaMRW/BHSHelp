  <h2>🌏 About This Website</h2>
  <h3>Helping International Students Navigate the New Zealand Education System</h3>
  
  <p>Starting school in a new country can be confusing—especially when everything feels unfamiliar. This website was created by an international student, for international students to make your journey through the New Zealand school system easier and less overwhelming.</p>
  
  <p>When I first arrived in New Zealand, I struggled to understand how the school system worked—terms like credits, levels, and NCEA were completely new to me. On top of that, I wasn’t sure what was allowed at school, how to find my classes, or who my teachers were. It was hard to ask for help when I didn’t even know what to ask. That’s why this website exists: to give you clear, friendly, and useful information in one place.</p>

  <h3>Here, you'll find tools and features designed to make your school life simpler:</h3>
